pish
====

Easy to use pinentry wrapper written in mksh. Basically, `pish` is an isolated copy of [kwalletcli-getpin](https://www.mirbsd.org/kwalletcli.htm "kwalletcli-getpin") with no KDE dependencies ,and some insecure code removed.


I'm thinking about rewriting it in bash. However, I'm assuming this code has been reviewed already, and I don't want to introduce any vulnerabilities.
